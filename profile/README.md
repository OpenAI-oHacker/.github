# 🧑‍💻 oHacker: AI Cybersecurity Agent with Attitude

Welcome to **oHacker**—your AI partner in **cybersecurity**, ready to test websites with a mischievous (but controlled!) vibe. 😈

Our mission? To **proactively identify web vulnerabilities** using AI agents. We simulate controlled "hacks" to help developers secure their applications before real threats do.

## 🤖 What We Do
We build AI agents designed for **automated web application security testing**. Think of oHacker as an AI security analyst that interacts with web applications via browser automation, attempts to identify potential weaknesses (like SQL Injection and Local File Inclusion), and generates reports detailing its findings.

## 📂 Our Core Repository

🔹 **[ohacker](https://github.com/OpenAI-oHacker/ohacker)**
  - The heart of the oHacker agent, containing the AI logic, backend simulation environment (for testing), and frontend interface.
  - Leverages **Python**, **OpenAI Agents SDK**, and **Playwright** for intelligent browser automation and security testing tasks.
  - Includes a **FastAPI** backend (serving as a testbed with simulated vulnerabilities) and a **React/TypeScript** frontend for interaction and visualization.

  *Architecture Overview:*
